Custom Markers
==============

These markers need to be uploaded as icons using https://mapbox.com/studio for the style that you are using in the map. The names should match the array `colors` defined in `config.json`. If you change the size you also need to change the icon offset defined in the local style in `map_view` - since these are pin-style icons they should not be centered on the point, instead the bottom of the pin should be on the point.
